## About FastLine

Fast Line is a multiplayer VR enabled game that can be played on both android and ios as well as on desktops. It is completely built on web technologies and no additional software or libraries are needed other than a latest browser. Full game is P2P. 

In Fast line, gamers will have to compete with each others in a maze to get to the checkpoint first. Player who reaches the checkpoint first wins the game. Player can see the other players around them and to avoid them reaching the checkpoint, he can use available obstacles in the map or bump to each other to get on their way. Players are moving at a constant speed and head tilt direct them to the location in VR headset. In a normal desktop keyboard and mouse can be used to achieve it. If the mobile phone does not have a gyroscope they can use the touch screen as well.
